Terraform Plugin Installation & Configuration in Jenkins (Ubuntu EC2)
Prerequisites

Jenkins is already installed and running on your Ubuntu EC2 instance.

Terraform is installed on your system and works for the jenkins user.
✅ Verified by:

sudo -u jenkins terraform -version

Step 1 — Download Terraform Plugin (.hpi) File

Open your browser and visit:
👉 https://plugins.jenkins.io/terraform/

Scroll down and click on "Archives" or "Download".
You’ll be redirected to a .hpi file (something like):

https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/terraform/<version>/terraform.hpi


Download that .hpi file to your local system (e.g., Downloads folder).

Example filename:

terraform.hpi

Step 2 — Upload Plugin to Jenkins

Go to Jenkins dashboard:

http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080


Navigate to:

Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Advanced


Scroll down to “Upload Plugin” section.

Click Choose File → Select the downloaded terraform.hpi file.

Click Upload.

Once uploaded, restart Jenkins from the UI or run:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins

Step 3 — Verify Plugin Installation

After restart:

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Installed


Search for “Terraform”.

✅ You should see:

Terraform Plugin (Installed)

Step 4 — Configure Terraform Tool in Jenkins

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration


Scroll down — you should now see a Terraform section.

Click “Add Terraform”, and enter:

Name: Terraform

Path to Terraform binary: /usr/bin/terraform

Click Save.

This tells Jenkins where to find Terraform on your system.
